## Insurance claims

Fraudulent claims are an important problem in the insurance industry. For instance, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the Association of British Insurers (ABI) is stepping up the fight against claims fraud. In particular, "The ABI in a report said that its members detected 139,000 bogus or exaggerated insurance claims last year, up 5% from 2010. The amount of money saved by insurers from detecting these bogus claims was around 983 million pounds (\$1.58 billion), up 7% from the previous year." "Most of that was from dishonest car drivers, who filed for GBP541 million worth of bogus claims. Another big source of fraud is home insurance, with dishonest homeowners filing for GBP106 million in fake claims last year."

You are a financial analyst investigating the problem of insurance fraud at one of the insurance companies in your market portfolio. This information is important because whether or not an insurance company can battle insurance fraud successfully says something about its financial soundness and management.

The insurance company gave you a random sample from their home insurance customer database with information on (among other things) claim type, cost of the claim, whether it was fraudulent, and several demographics of the insured customer. This data file will give you a snapshot of the fraud situation at the insurance company.
